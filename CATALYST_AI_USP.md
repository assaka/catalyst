| **Bolt.new** | Code-heavy, requires deployment | True no-code + instant deployment |
| **V0.dev** | UI components only, no backend | Full-stack with database, payments, shipping |
| **Shopify** | Template-locked, expensive apps | Unlimited customization with AI |
| **WooCommerce** | WordPress baggage, slow | Modern React stack, lightning fast |
