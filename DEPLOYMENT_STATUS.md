# Deployment Status - Entity/Controller/Migration System

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Backend Not Deployed

### Current Situation
- ✅ All code pushed to GitHub (30+ commits)
- ❌ Backend NOT deployed to Render
- ❌ Production running old code without new endpoints

### Why Delete "Doesn't Work"
The error `Network error: Unable to connect to server` happens because:

```
Frontend tries: DELETE https://catalyst-backend-fzhu.onrender.com/api/plugins/registry/:id/files
                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                                        Endpoint doesn't exist yet!
```

The production backend doesn't have this endpoint because it hasn't been redeployed.

### Missing Endpoints on Production

All these endpoints exist in GitHub but NOT on Render:

1. `DELETE /api/plugins/registry/:id/files` - Delete files
2. `POST /api/plugins/:id/run-migration` - Run migrations
3. `POST /api/plugins/:id/generate-entity-migration` - Generate migrations
4. `GET /api/plugins/registry/:id` - (Updated to load entities/controllers/migrations)
5. `PUT /api/plugins/registry/:id/files` - (Updated to handle entity saves)

### Missing Tables on Production

These tables need to be created:
- `plugin_entities` - Entity definitions
- `plugin_controllers` - API endpoints
- `plugin_migrations` - Migration tracking

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render

**Manual Deployment:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find service: `catalyst-backend-fzhu`
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"**
4. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Wait for deployment (~2-5 minutes)
6. Check logs for **"Deployment succeeded"**

### Step 2: Create Database Tables

**Option A: Via Render Shell**
```bash
# In Render dashboard → Shell tab
cd /app
node backend/run-core-plugin-tables.js
```

**Option B: Via Local Script to Production DB**
```bash
# Make sure DATABASE_URL points to production
node backend/run-core-plugin-tables.js
```

**Option C: Manual SQL Execution**
Run these SQL files in Supabase dashboard:
- `backend/src/database/migrations/create-plugin-entities-table.sql`
- `backend/src/database/migrations/create-plugin-controllers-table.sql`
- `backend/src/database/migrations/create-plugin-migrations-table.sql`

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

**Test DELETE endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE https://catalyst-backend-fzhu.onrender.com/api/plugins/registry/test-id/files \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/test.js"}'
```

Expected: 404 (file not found) or 200 (success)
Not expected: 404 (route not found) or CORS error

**Check Render Logs:**
Look for:
```
🗑️ DELETE /registry/:id/files called
   req.params: { id: '...' }
   req.body: { path: '/...' }
```

## 📊 Commits Waiting for Deployment

Recent commits (last 10):
```
85bcbdb3 - Add schema comparison logging
d33441ab - Add comprehensive DELETE debugging
f3030807 - Fix removed column detection
88092056 - Add descriptive ALTER TABLE naming
428a9a92 - Fix migration result modal
... (20+ more commits)
```

## ✅ What Will Work After Deployment

Once deployed, these features will work:

**File Management:**
- ✅ Delete entities, controllers, events, scripts
- ✅ View all file types in FileTree
- ✅ Save entity files to plugin_entities

**Migration System:**
- ✅ Generate CREATE TABLE migrations
- ✅ Generate ALTER TABLE migrations with:
  - ADD COLUMN for new columns
  - DROP COLUMN for removed columns
  - ALTER COLUMN for modified columns
- ✅ Descriptive migration names
- ✅ Run migrations from AI Studio
- ✅ Migration status panel with warnings

**Schema Detection:**
- ✅ Automatically detect table existence
- ✅ Compare old vs new schemas
- ✅ Detect added/removed/modified columns
- ✅ Generate appropriate warnings

## 🎯 Current Testing Environment

You can test locally by:
1. Ensuring local database has the tables
2. Running backend locally: `npm run dev`
3. Testing features against localhost:5000

## 🔥 Action Required

**DEPLOY BACKEND TO RENDER NOW!**

Without deployment, none of the new features will work in production:
- No file deletion
- No migration generation
- No entities/controllers in FileTree
- No ALTER TABLE detection

**All code is ready - just needs deployment!** 🚀
