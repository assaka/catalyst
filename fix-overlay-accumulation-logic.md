# Fix: Overlay System Should Accumulate Changes Instead of Overriding

## Problem Identified

Currently in `backend/src/services/version-control-service.js:102`, the system completely **overwrites** `current_code` with new edits:

```javascript
await customization.update({
  current_code: modifiedCode,  // ❌ This replaces all previous changes
  updated_at: new Date()
});
```

## Why This is Wrong

1. **Lost Changes**: Each new edit completely removes all previous changes
2. **No Accumulation**: Changes should build upon each other, not replace each other
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users expect their incremental edits to be preserved

## The Fix Strategy

We need to change the logic so that:

1. `modifiedCode` parameter represents the **full editor content** (including all accumulated changes)
2. The system compares `modifiedCode` with the **original baseline** (not the previous current_code)
3. `current_code` stores the accumulated result of ALL changes from baseline

## Current Flow (INCORRECT):
```
Baseline: "My Cart"
Edit 1: Change to "Your Cart" → current_code = "Your Cart" ✅
Edit 2: Change to "Hamid Cart" → current_code = "Hamid Cart" ❌ (lost "Your" vs "My" change)
```

## Correct Flow (SHOULD BE):
```
Baseline: "My Cart"  
Edit 1: Editor now has "Your Cart" → current_code = "Your Cart" ✅
Edit 2: Editor now has "Hamid Cart" → current_code = "Hamid Cart" ✅
Both changes are preserved because current_code reflects the full editor state
```

## The Key Insight

The `modifiedCode` parameter in `applyChanges()` should represent the **complete current state of the editor**, not just the incremental change. The current implementation is correct, but we need to ensure that the frontend is sending the full accumulated editor content.

## Root Cause

The issue might be in how the frontend calls the auto-save API. Let's check if it's sending:
- ❌ Just the diff/changes 
- ✅ The complete file content with all accumulated changes

## Action Items

1. ✅ Verify the current implementation is architecturally correct
2. ❌ Check what the frontend is actually sending to the API
3. ❌ Ensure auto-save sends complete file content, not just diffs
4. ❌ Test the fix with multiple sequential edits
